                <br> * You can click on cubes, and they will change their faces as well as colors
                <br> * Every color affects cubes around in diferent ways depending on color, so that they change their faces as well as colors
                <br> * If the new color of the CLICKED cube is the same as the colors from the left and right or from the top and bottom, three cubes will disappear and you will earn 3 secs.
